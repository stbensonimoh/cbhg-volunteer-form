# CBHG Volunteer Application Form
This is an application form for CBHG.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start `to start the development server.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

## Usage
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

```bash
npm start
```

 This runs the app in the development mode. It opens http://localhost:3000 in the browser and automatically reloads the page when changes are made. You can also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm test
```
This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Refer to the running tests section in the Create React App documentation for more information.

```bash
npm run build 
```
This builds the app for production. The optimized and minified files are placed in the build folder. This command prepares the app for deployment.

## Deployment

# CBHG Volunteer Application Form
This is a volunteer application form for CBHG.

## Getting Started
This project is built using `React.js` for the frontend and uses `Netlify functions` for the API. It requires Netlify CLI and Node.js version 14 or later.

Installing the CLI globally provides access to the `netlify` command. To install, run the following command from any directory in your terminal:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `netlify dev`to start the development server. It should open the application in a browser, otherwise see the terminal for information on the address and port the app is running.

## Usage
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

```bash
netlify dev
```

 This runs the app in the development mode. It opens the app in the browser and automatically reloads the page when changes are made. You can also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm test
```
This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Refer to the running tests section in the Create React App documentation for more information.

```bash
npm run build 
```
This builds the app for production. The optimized and minified files are placed in the build folder. This command prepares the app for deployment.

## Deployment
